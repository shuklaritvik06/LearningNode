# Proxy

A proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. It saves from any malware or attacks as a FIREWALL. It is also used for better management. Suppose many users are requesting the same data again and again so it can cache the data and can give it to the user without again requesting from the server. It can also hide the IP address by encryption so the final server does not know from where does the request actually cam from.

# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers. It has all the benefits of the proxy server but also has a benefit of **LOAD BALANCING**. Reverse proxy acts a load balancer and redirects the requests to the different servers to balance the load. Also it cache in the reverse proxy if several requests are made requesting same content. It helps in compressing the request and response thus improving the performance.
