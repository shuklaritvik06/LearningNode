# Basics

## What is difference between SOAP and REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that the developer can use in building his/her web api. It was given by Roy fielding in his doctorate. It consists of some constraints.

- Client & Server
- Layered System
- Cacheable
- Statelessness
- Uniform Interface

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a **messaging protocol** that was developed for exchanging structured information over web services. It uses XML (Extensible Markup Language) as a format for sending messages between applications over the internet. Cant be cached.

## Types of Testing

- Functional
- Integration
- Regression
- Security
- Load
- Penetration
- Fuzz testing

Functional Testing: This type of testing verifies that the API meets the functional requirements specified in the documentation or the API design.

Integration Testing: This testing involves testing the integration between various components of the API to ensure that they work together seamlessly.

Load Testing: This testing verifies the API's ability to handle a large number of concurrent requests and responses without slowing down or crashing.

Security Testing: This testing verifies the API's security features, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and access control.

Regression testing is a type of software testing that is performed to ensure that changes or modifications made to an existing software application do not affect the existing functionality of the application.

Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a type of security testing that is performed on a software application, system, or network to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers.
