## Certificate Pinning

Certificate pinning is a security feature that allows an application to hardcode a set of trusted certificates. The application will then only trust those certificates and will not trust any other certificates. This is useful for applications that need to ensure that they are communicating with a specific server and not a malicious server impersonating that server.
